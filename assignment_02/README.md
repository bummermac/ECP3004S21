# Assignment 2

Upload your script ```my_functions.py``` to a folder with (exactly!) the same name (```assignment_02```)
within your repository. 



## Notes on Submission of Assignments (Copied from Assignment 1)

1. As a collaborator to your repository, I can view your submissions and that is where I will look to grade your assignments.
1. I can modify your submission to add comments or make minor corrections to improve the display.
1. It is better if I do not have to make such adjustments. 
You can help by following these practices:

- Save your work in your own private repository, instead of a fork of my repository (although that was acceptable this time).
- Save your work in a folder called (exactly!) ```assignment_02```, 
where ```2``` is the number of this assignment. 
Note the underscore, the zero and the lower-case ```a```. 
This will be more important in this and future assignments, as I will run your programs and this will only work if they are named and located as required. 
- Make sure to name your files *exactly* as specified. 
- For example, some of you use a convention ```FINALSUBMISSION_my_functions.py``` for the program that was required to be called ```my_functions.py```. 
If you want to keep previous versions, you might instead follow the habit of naming your final submission ```my_functions.py``` and save any previous work as ```my_functions_prelim.py```.
- An easy way to do this is to begin working on your assignments 
by copying the folder ```assignment_02``` and its contents 
from the course repository to your private repository. 
- A script that runs is infinitely better than a script that throws an error. 
- A script that runs and calculates the wrong value in some cases but works in other is less-than-ideal but acceptable. 
- A script that runs in all cases and calculates the correct values is the goal you should strive for. 
- The best way to acieve this is to *run your script* to test it yourself. 
- Don't assume it works just because it looks good or makes sense. 
- Everyone makes mistakes. Good programmers test their code, find the mistakes and correct them. 

To grade your assignment, I will run the program called
```my_functions.py``` in the folder ```assignment_02```.

### What Happens After I Run the Programs?

I ran your programs and those from the suggested solutions 
and these programs output the results you see above. 

- The file ```my_functions.py``` is your submission. 
When I run it, it produces the output ```my_functions_out.txt```. 
This shows the results of evaluating your examples. 


- The file ```my_functions_soln.py``` is the suggested solutions. 
When I run it, it produces the output ```my_functions_soln_out.txt```. 



- The file ```my_functions_test.py``` is a script that runs examples 
to test your submission ```my_functions.py```. 
When I run it, it produces the output ```my_functions_test_out.txt```. 
This script tests your functions in several ways: 
using the examples you provided, 
using the examples in the suggested solutions, and
using an automated testing procedure using the examples 
in the docstrings of your functions (if you didn't forget them). 


- The file ```my_functions_soln_test.py``` is a script that runs examples 
to test the suggested solutions ```my_functions_soln.py```. 
When I run it, it produces the output ```my_functions_soln_test_out.txt```.
