# Assignment 5

Upload your script ```my_A5_module.py``` to a folder with (exactly!) the same name (```assignment_05```)
within your repository. 



## Notes on Submission of Assignments


- A script that runs is infinitely better than a script that throws an error. 
- A script that runs and calculates the wrong value in some cases but works in other is less-than-ideal but acceptable. 
- A script that runs in all cases and calculates the correct values is the goal you should strive for. 
- The best way to acieve this is to *run your script* to test it yourself. 
- Don't assume it works just because it looks good or makes sense. 
- Everyone makes mistakes. Good programmers test their code, find the mistakes and correct them. 

To grade your assignment, I will run the program called
```my_A5_module.py``` (among others) in the folder ```assignment_05```.
